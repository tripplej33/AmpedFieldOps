# Project Memory Log

## 2026-01-17
- User request: Initialize self-documenting files and create a branch from current pulled commit.
- Actions planned: Create `memory.md`, `mistakes_to_not_repeat.md`, `Internal_System_Documentation.md`, `prompt_for_more_context.md`; create a branch from commit `fdd8c458d589ca6563fc6bfa631745f703c4959b`; commit and push.
- Context: Repo freshly cloned at detached HEAD and installed via `install.sh`; containers healthy.
